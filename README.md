## ALX Simple Shell Team Project.

This project is a collaborative effort by ALX focused on creating a shell program inspired by the Bash shell. Our team was assigned the task of developing a user-friendly shell, and we have decided to name our creation "hsh."

## Requirements

**General:**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Betty coding style is followed.
- The simple shell has no known memory leaks
